# ProbingEfficiencey-Hashing-
An assignment that was developed for Algorithms and data structures.</br>
The purpose of the assignment was to enhance the understanding of hashing.</br>

- Result table compares linear and quadratic probing.
- Tests are done for different load factors.
- Average comparisons made while probing are calculated.
- The practical values are then compared with theoretical values.</br>
(Formulas for theoretical values are taken from Donald Knuth from his 1998 edition of his book The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 3)
- A table is formed displaying all the values and the difference observed.
